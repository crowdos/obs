An OBS source service that converts a git repos to a debian .dsc file and all its auxillary supplements

git repos requirements:
 - When building a tag:
  - A git repos tag should have a corresponding debian/changelog entry
  - The git repos snapshot will be exported as it is.

 - When not building a tag:
  - An empty changelog entry will be added

If we are building a tag but we do not have a corresponding debian/changelog entry, we will abort.
